          SyftBox is an open-source protocol that enables privacy-preserving
          computations across distributed networks, powering NSAI (Network
          Sourced AI) - a revolutionary system that unlocks the world's
          distributed intelligence by combining private and public models into
          powerful ensembles. Through its ecosystem of SyftUI, Syft LLM Router,
          and Syft Apps, SyftBox creates a decentralized marketplace where model
          providers can monetize their capabilities while developers access
          unique AI ensembles without sacrificing data ownership or privacy.

            <div class="overview-content">
              <p>
                NSAI (Network Sourced AI) is an open-source protocol that
                combines private and public models into powerful ensembles while
                keeping users in control. It addresses the problem that most of
                the world's intelligence is locked away in private datasets,
                proprietary models, and local environments, where centralization
                isn't feasible or scalable. Instead of centralizing
                intelligence, NSAI builds infrastructure for distributed,
                collaborative AI development through permissioned ensembles that
                respect ownership and reward contributions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The protocol creates an open marketplace connecting three key
                participants: Private Model Providers who serve private data or
                models while maintaining privacy for monetization; Model Users
                including companies and developers who consume these models for
                superior results, particularly through ensemble capabilities;
                and Model Hosts who provide infrastructure to serve models for
                compensation. This decentralized architecture functions like a
                distributed version of OpenRouter, enabling collaborative AI
                while preserving privacy, ownership rights, and individual
                control over computational resources.

            <div class="overview-content">
              <p>
                SyftBox is an open-source protocol that enables
                privacy-preserving computations across distributed datasets
                without requiring data centralization. It allows developers and
                organizations to run analyses on data that remains securely with
                its original owners, never being copied or moved.
              </p>
              <p>
                The platform operates by creating a network of "datasites"
                similar to how the internet connects websites. Each datasite is
                essentially a folder on someone's computer that they maintain
                full control over, with Unix-like permissions governing access.
                SyftBox acts as a lightweight orchestrator that enables approved
                applications to run computations directly on the data owner's
                system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The key advantages include simplified development across
                different programming languages and environments, secure
                collaboration between partners and researchers while maintaining
                privacy, enhanced trust through auditable frameworks, and true
                privacy by design where data owners retain complete control.
                This approach enables valuable insights and collaboration at
                scale while breaking down the barriers that typically keep
                non-public data siloed, allowing selective participation in
                computations with minimal information disclosure.

            <div class="overview-content">
              <p>
                Syft UI is a sleek user interface for SyftBox that provides an
                intuitive gateway to federated data science. It comes in two
                versions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Desktop App (Recommended): An all-in-one bundle that includes
                  the SyftBox daemon, requiring no additional setup. Simply
                  download and run the application, with versions available for
                  Windows, Linux, and Mac (both Apple Silicon and Intel).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Web App: A lightweight option that connects to any SyftBox
                  daemon (local or remote), ideal for headless setups or
                  low-resource environments. Users can access it through a web
                  link and connect using their SyftBox client URL and token.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The platform is designed for ease of use - the desktop version
                offers a one-click installation experience, while the web
                version provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios.
                For developers, SyftUI includes development tools with hot
                reload capabilities and simple build commands for packaging
                applications across different operating systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                SyftUI essentially makes SyftBox's privacy-preserving federated
                computing capabilities accessible through an intuitive
                interface, allowing users to participate in distributed data
                science without needing deep technical knowledge of the
                underlying protocol.

            <h2 class="overview-title">Syft Apps Overview</h2>
            <div class="overview-content">
              <p>
                Syft Apps are applications designed to interact with data across
                the SyftBox distributed network, capable of processing both
                private data confined to individual datasites and data synced
                from other datasites while maintaining established privacy
                constraints. These applications are language-agnostic, allowing
                developers to use their preferred programming language, with
                Python developers benefiting from a dedicated SDK for
                streamlined development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The essential structure consists of a directory placed under the
                "apps" folder containing a mandatory "run.sh" file that serves
                as the application runner script. For Python-based applications,
                the typical structure includes both the "run.sh" script for
                environment setup and execution alongside a "main.py" file
                containing the actual implementation code. The SyftBox client
                provides seamless integration by automatically scanning for new
                applications every 10 seconds and executing them without
                requiring user intervention. Installation is straightforward -
                users simply copy files from a repository or local directory
                into their "apps" folder. This elegant design enables
                applications to become core components of the network,
                facilitating various operations including data analysis, machine
                learning, and visualization while maintaining established
                permission boundaries and privacy constraints across the
                federated ecosystem.

            <h2 class="overview-title">The router concept Overview</h2>
            <div class="overview-content">
              <p>
                The Syft LLM Router is a framework for creating and deploying
                Language Model applications built on top of SyftBox. It provides
                a standardized way to create, deploy, and share LLM routers that
                can be accessed through the SyftBox federated computing network.
                The system enables developers to build privacy-preserving LLM
                applications that can run across distributed environments while
                maintaining data control and security.
              </p>
              <h3>Core Data Models and API Structure</h3>
              <p>
                The router system uses well-defined Pydantic models to ensure
                consistent API interactions. The core message structure includes
                role-based conversation handling with system, user, and
                assistant roles. The system supports both chat completions and
                text completions through dedicated response models, each
                containing essential fields like model name, generated content,
                usage statistics, and finish reasons. Generation options are
                controlled through configurable parameters including
                temperature, top-p sampling, maximum tokens, and stop sequences.
              </p>
              <h3>Quick Start and Router Development</h3>
              <p>
                Creating a new router application is straightforward with the
                provided CLI tools:
              </p>
              <pre><code>$ uv run syftllm create-router-app -n my-llm-router<br>$ cd my-llm-router</code></pre>
              <p>
                This creates a directory with essential files including
                router.py for implementing LLM provider logic, server.py for
                configuring the SyftEvents server, and pyproject.toml for
                dependency management. The router implementation involves
                defining LLM providers, implementing chat and completion
                endpoints, and adding custom functionality as needed. Starting
                the router server creates an RPC server over SyftBox that
                handles LLM requests in a federated manner.
              </p>
              <h3>Publishing and Metadata Management</h3>
              <p>
                The publishing system uses a sophisticated metadata management
                approach through the PublishHandler class. This system validates
                project structure, generates code hashes for integrity, and
                processes project metadata from configuration files. The
                publishing configuration includes three pricing models:
              </p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li>per-request</li>
                  <li>per-tokens</li>
                  <li>free usage</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                The system ensures all required files are present before
                allowing publication and handles comprehensive metadata
                including project name, description, tags, dependencies, and
                documented endpoints.
              </p>
              <h3>RPC Servers and SyftBox Integration</h3>
              <p>
                The core of the system lies in creating RPC servers over SyftBox
                that enable distributed LLM services across the federated
                network. The RPC server architecture facilitates seamless
                communication between different datasites while maintaining
                privacy and control over computational resources. The server
                acts as a bridge between the SyftBox network and the actual LLM
                implementation, processing requests and routing them to
                appropriate language model endpoints. The system automatically
                generates RPC schemas that document available endpoints and
                their specifications, serving as contracts between clients and
                servers. When a router is published, its metadata and
                accessibility information are stored in the datasite's public
                folder structure, creating a federated marketplace where users
                can discover and access LLM routers hosted on different
                datasites across the network.
              </p>
              <h3>Document Embedding and Network Architecture</h3>
              <p>
                The system includes advanced document processing capabilities
                with configurable chunk sizes, batch processing, and similarity
                thresholds for document retrieval. The distributed architecture
                enables several key capabilities: users can access LLM services
                without centralizing data, providers can monetize their models
                through different pricing schemes, and the network can scale
                horizontally as more datasites contribute computational
                resources.
              </p>
              <h3>Security and Privacy Features</h3>
              <p>
                The RPC server implementation maintains SyftBox's core privacy
                principles by ensuring that data processing occurs locally on
                the datasite hosting the LLM router. Requests are processed
                without exposing sensitive information to other network
                participants, and the standardized API ensures that only
                authorized operations can be performed. The system supports
                authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to
                specific LLM services based on user permissions and pricing
                models.
              </p>
              <h3>Examples and Use Cases</h3>
              <p>
                The framework includes complete implementations for different
                LLM providers, such as Phi-4 and Mixtral routers found in the
                examples folder. Each example demonstrates the full lifecycle
                from router implementation to server configuration, including
                test scripts and documentation. This creates a robust ecosystem
                where developers can build, deploy, and share LLM capabilities
                across the SyftBox federated network while maintaining complete
                control over their data and computational resources.
